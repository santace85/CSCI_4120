# HW1 for CSCI_4120

### Description:
  This Jupyter Notebook is used to try and predict the classification of iris flowers. The data is shuffled and split into test and training data. 
KNN is repeated for each k (from 1 to 20), for five times and average accuracy is calculated and used as the result.

### Team member: 
  Henry Santacruz

### Requirements:
  Jupyter Notebook is required to view this file. 

### Which K (from 1 to 20) works the best? 
  Results were very similar from K 1 through 20. KNN is simple and quick to implement but lazy and doesn't optimize with more data.
  I think a different algorithm will have better results with the data.
