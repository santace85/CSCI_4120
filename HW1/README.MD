# HW1 for CSCI_4120

### Description:
This Jupyter Notebook is used to try and predict the classification of iris flowers. The data is shuffled and split into test and training data. 
KNN is repeated for each k (from 1 to 20), for five times and average accuracy is calculated and used as the result.

### Team member:

### Requirements:
Jupyter Notebook is required to view this file. 
You also need to install pandas, numpy, and matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook.

### Which K (from 1 to 20) works the best?

Results were very similar from K 1 through 20 (Check the image above).
KNN is simple and quick to implement but lazy and doesn't optimize with more data.
I think a different algorithm will have better results with the data.
